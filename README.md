🔥 Wildfire Detection with InceptionV3
->This project uses a deep learning model (InceptionV3) to detect wildfires in images.

🚀 Features
->Trained on Wildfire Dataset
->Binary classification: fire 🔥 vs nofire 🌲
->Grad-CAM used for visual explanation of predictions
->Achieves high accuracy on test data

🛠️ Model
->InceptionV3 (pretrained, fine-tuned for wildfire classification)
->Data Augmentation + Normalization
->Optimizer: Adam | Loss: CrossEntropy

📊 Results
->Includes accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score on test set
->Grad-CAM highlights fire regions in the image
